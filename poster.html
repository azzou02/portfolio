                <p>This oil painting deliberately emulates the style of 
                    communist propaganda posters, to add more to my exploration 
                    of bravery, perception, and societal influence through this 
                    painting. The composition centers on me, wearing a worker's 
                    cap typical of communist iconography. My posture and 
                    expression evoke the idealized, confident worker often 
                    depicted in such posters.

                    Two birds of prey frame the scene, possibly representing 
                    freedom or authority, depending on one's viewpoint. 
                    Moreover, by adopting the visual language of communist 
                    posters - bold colors, heroic posturing, and symbolic 
                    imagery - the painting invites viewers to consider how 
                    propaganda shapes our understanding of reality.
                    
                    I used this stylistic choice to reinforce how education 
                    (or lack thereof) and cultural context influence our 
                    interpretation of symbols and situations. Overall, the 
                    artwork highlights the malleability of perception and the 
                    subjective experience of truth. I want to challenge viewers 
                    to examine their biases and the lenses through which they 
                    view the world, politics, and concepts of heroism or danger.
