                <h1 class="sub-title">Plant Immunity Cover Art</h1>
                <p>This artwork draws inspiration from the design of a 
                    playing card, particularly the Queen card, where the
                     image is mirrored so it can be seen from both sides.
                     This concept was perfect for illustrating the 
                     complex relationship between receptor-like 
                     proteins (RLPs) and receptor-like kinases (RLKs) 
                     in plant immune response signaling. In the design,
                     I used a mirror as a central motif to visually 
                     represent the relationship between RLPs and RLKs.
                     The mirror reflects the idea that, while these two 
                     types of proteins share structural similarities, 
                     they function differently in the context of immune 
                     response to biotic attacks. By depicting an RLP 
                     looking into the mirror and seeing the reflection 
                     of an RLK, I wanted to convey the notion that these
                      proteins are like counterparts, reflecting each 
                     other in form, but differing in their roles and 
                     mechanisms within the plantâ€™s immune system. The 
                     frame of the artwork is composed of plants and 
                     chemical structures, which serve as both a 
                     decorative and informative element. The plants
                     symbolize the biological context of the immune 
                     response. The inclusion of chemical structures 
                     around the frame represents the specific biotic 
                     attacks that trigger immune responses in plants. 
                     These structures act as visual examples of the 
                     types of molecular interactions that RLPs and RLKs 
                     respond to, further reinforcing the scientific 
                     narrative of the artwork.
